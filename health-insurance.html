        <h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE :</h2>
        <p>
          A Health Insurance Policy would normally cover expenses reasonably and
          necessarily incurred under the following heads in respect of each
          insured person subject to overall ceiling of sum insured (for all
          claims during one policy period).
        </p>
        <div class="box">
          <small>1. Room, Boarding expenses</small>
          <small>2. Nursing expenses</small>
          <small
            >3. Fees of surgeon, anesthetist, physician, consultants,
            specialists</small
          >
          <small
            >4. Anesthesia, blood, oxygen, operation theatre charges, surgical
            appliances, medicines, drugs, diagnostic materials, X-ray, Dialysis,
            chemotherapy, Radio therapy, cost of pace maker, Artificial limbs,
            cost or organs and similar expenses.</small
          >
        </div>

        <h2>Sum Insured:</h2>
        <p>
          The Sum Insured offered may be on an individual basis or on floater
          basis for the family as a whole.
        </p>

        <h2>Cumulative Bonus (CB):</h2>
        <p>
          Health Insurance policies may offer Cumulative Bonus wherein for every
          claim free year, the Sum Insured is increased by a certain percentage
          at the time of renewal subject to a maximum percentage (generally
          50%). In case of a claim, CB will be reduced by 10% at the next
          renewal.
        </p>

        <h2>Cost of Health Check-up:</h2>
        <p>
          Health policies may also contain a provision for reimbursement of cost
          of health check up. Read your policy carefully to understand what is
          allowed.
        </p>
        <h2>Minimum period of stay in Hospital :</h2>
        <p>
          In order to become eligible to make a claim under the policy, minimum
          stay in the Hospital is necessary for a certain number of hours.
          Usually this is 24 hours. This time limit may not apply for treatment
          of accidental injuries and for certain specified treatments. Read the
          policy provision to understand the details.
        </p>

        <h2>Pre and post hospitalization expenses :</h2>
        <p>
          Expenses incurred during a certain number of days prior to
          hospitalization and post hospitalization expenses for a specified
          period from the date of discharge may be considered as part of the
          claim provided the expenses relate to the disease / sickness. Go
          through the specific provision in this regard.
        </p>

        <h2>Cashless Facility :</h2>
        <p>
          Insurance companies have tie-up arrangements with a network of
          hospitals in the country. If policyholder takes treatment in any of
          the net work hospitals, there is no need for the insured person to pay
          hospital bills. The Insurance Company, through its Third Party
          Administrator (TPA) will arrange direct payment to the Hospital.
          Expenses beyond sub limits prescribed by the policy or items not
          covered under the policy have to be settled by the insured direct to
          the Hospital. The insured can take treatment in a non-listed hospital
          in which case he has to pay the bills first and then seek
          reimbursement from Insurance Co. There will be no cashless facility
          applicable here.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Critical illness policy:</h2>
        <p>
          A Critical Illness benefit policy provides a fixed lumpsum amount to
          the insured in case of diagnosis of a specified illness or on
          undergoing a specified procedure. This amount is helpful in mitigating
          various direct and indirect financial consequences of a critical
          illness. Usually, once this lump sum is paid, the plan ceases to
          remain in force. However, continuation of coverage to other critical
          illnesses is subject to terms and conditions of policy contract.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional Benefits and other stand alone policies :</h2>
        <p>
          Insurance companies offer various other benefits as “Add-ons” or
          riders. There are also stand alone policies that are designed to give
          benefits like “Hospital Cash”, “Critical Illness Benefits”, “Surgical
          Expense Benefits” etc. These policies can either be taken separately
          or in addition to the hospitalization policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few companies have come out with products in the nature of Top Up
          policies to meet the actual expenses over and above the limit
          available in the basic health policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Exclusions :</h2>
        <p>The following are generally excluded under health policies:</p>
        <div class="box">

        <h2>Some Question & Answer:</h2>
        <div class="accordion">
          <p>1. What is Health Insurance?</p>
          <small>
            The term health insurance is a type of insurance that covers your
            medical expenses. A health insurance policy is a contract between an
            insurer and an individual /group in which the insurer agrees to
            provide specified health insurance cover at a particular “premium”.
          </small>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">
          <p>2. What are the forms of Health Insurance available?</p>
          <small>
            The commonest form of health insurance policies in India cover the
            expenses incurred on Hospitalization, though a variety of products
            are now available which offer a range of health covers, depending on
            the need and choice of the insured. The health insurer usually
            provides either direct payment to hospital (cashless facility) or
            reimburses the expenses associated with illnesses and injuries or
            disburses a fixed benefit on occurrence of an illness. The type and
            amount of health care costs that will be covered by the health plan
            are specified in advance.
          </small>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">
          <p>3. Why is Health Insurance important?</p>
          <small>
            All of us should buy health insurance and for all members of our
            family, according to our needs. Buying health insurance protects us
            from the sudden, unexpected costs of hospitalization (or other
            covered health events, like critical illnesses) which would
            otherwise make a major dent into household savings or even lead to
            indebtedness.Each of us is exposed to various health hazards and a
            medical emergency can strike anyone of us without any prior warning.
            Healthcare is increasingly expensive, with technological advances,
            new procedures and more effective medicines that have also driven up
            the costs of healthcare. While these high treatment expenses may be
            beyond the reach of many, taking the security of health insurance is
            much more affordable.
          </small>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">
          <p>4. What kinds of Health Insurance plans are available?</p>
          <small>
            Health insurance policies are available from a sum insured of Rs
            5000 in micro-insurance policies to even a sum insured of Rs 50
            lakhs or more in certain critical illness plans. Most insurers offer
            policies between 1 lakh to 5 lakh sum insured. As the room rents and
            other expenses payable by insurers are increasingly being linked to
            the sum insured opted for, it is advisable to take adequate cover
            from an early age, particularly because it may not be easy to
            increase the sum insured after a claim occurs. Also, while most
            non-life insurance companies offer health insurance policies for a
            duration of one year, there are policies that are issued for two,
            three, four and five years duration also. Life insurance companies
            have plans which could extend even longer in the duration. A
            Hospitalization policy covers, fully or partly, the actual cost of
            the treatment for hospital admissions during the policy period. This
            is a wider form of coverage applicable for various hospitalization
            expenses, including expenses before and after hospitalization for
            some specified period. Such policies may be available on individual
            sum insured basis, or on a family floater basis where the sum
            insured is shared across the family members. Another type of
            product, the Hospital Daily Cash Benefit policy, provides a fixed
            daily sum insured for each day of hospitalization. There may also be
            coverage for a higher daily benefit in case of ICU admissions or for
            specified illnesses or injuries. A Critical Illness benefit policy
            provides a fixed lumpsum amount to the insured in case of diagnosis
            of a specified illness or on undergoing a specified procedure. This
            amount is helpful in mitigating various direct and indirect
            financial consequences of a critical illness. Usually, once this
            lump sum is paid, the plan ceases to remain in force. There are also
            other types of products, which offer lumpsum payment on undergoing a
            specified surgery (Surgical Cash Benefit), and others catering to
            the needs of specified target audience like senior citizens.

          <p>5 .What is cashless facility?</p>
          <small>
            Insurance companies have tie-up arrangements with several hospitals
            all over the country as part of their network. Under a health
            insurance policy offering cashless facility, a policyholder can take
            treatment in any of the network hospitals without having to pay the
            hospital bills as the payment is made to the hospital directly by
            the Third Party Administrator, on behalf of the insurance company.
            However, expenses beyond the limits or sub-limits allowed by the
            insurance policy or expenses not covered under the policy have to be
            settled by you directly with the hospital. Cashless facility,
            however, is not available if you take treatment in a hospital that
            is not in the network.

            6 . What are the tax benefits I get if I opt for Health Insurance?
          </p>
          <small>
            Health insurance comes with attractive tax benefits as an added
            incentive. There is an exclusive section of the Income Tax Act which
            provides tax benefits for health insurance, which is Section 80D,
            and which is unlike the section 80C applicable to Life Insurance
            wherein other form of investments/ expenditure also qualify for the
            deduction. Currently, purchasers of health insurance who have
            purchased the policy by any payment mode other than cash can avail
            of an annual deduction of Rs. 15,000 from their taxable income for
            payment of Health Insurance premium for self, spouse and dependent
            children. For senior citizens, this deduction is higher, and is Rs.
            20,000. Further, since the financial year 2008-09, an additional Rs
            15,000 is available as deduction for health insurance premium paid
            on behalf of parents, which again is Rs 20,000 if the parents are
            senior citizens.

          <p>7 . What are the factors that affect Health Insurance premium?</p>
          <small>
            Age is a major factor that determines the premium, the older you are
            the premium cost will be higher because you are more prone to
            illnesses. Previous medical history is another major factor that
            determines the premium. If no prior medical history exists, premium
            will automatically be lower. Claim free years can also be a factor
            in determining the cost of the premium as it might benefit you with
            certain percentage of discount. This will automatically help you
            reduce your premium.

          <p>8 . What does a Health Insurance policy not cover?</p>
          <small>
            You must read the prospectus/ policy and understand what is not
            covered under it. Generally, pre-existing diseases (read the policy
            to understand what a pre-existing disease is defined as) are
            excluded under a Health Insurance policy. Further, the policy would
            generally exclude certain diseases from the first year of coverage
            and also impose a waiting period. There would also be certain
            standard exclusions such as cost of spectacles, contact lenses and
            hearing aids not being covered, dental treatment/surgery ( unless
            requiring hospitalization) not being covered, convalescence, general
            debility, congenital external defects, venereal disease, intentional
            self-injury, use of intoxicating drugs/alcohol, AIDS, expenses for
            diagnosis, x-ray or laboratory tests not consistent with the disease
            requiring hospitalization, treatment relating to pregnancy or child
            birth including cesarean section, Naturopathy treatment.

          <p>9 . Is there any Waiting Period for claims under a policy?</p>
          <small>
            Yes. When you get a new policy, generally, there will be a 30 days
            waiting period starting from the policy inception date, during which
            period any hospitalization charges will not be payable by the
            insurance companies. However, this is not applicable to any
            emergency hospitalization occurring due to an accident. This waiting
            period will not be applicable for subsequent policies under renewal.

          <p>10 . What is pre-existing condition in health insurance policy?</p>
          <small>
            It is a medical condition/disease that existed before you obtained
            health insurance policy, and it is significant, because the
            insurance companies do not cover such pre-existing conditions,
            within 48 months of prior to the 1st policy. It means, pre-existing
            conditions can be considered for payment after completion of 48
            months of continuous insurance cover.

            be denied for renewal?
          </p>
          <small>
            The policy will be renewable provided you pay the premium within 15
            days (called as Grace Period) of expiry date. However, coverage
            would not be available for the period for which no premium is
            received by the insurance company. The policy will lapse if the
            premium is not paid within the grace period.

            without losing the renewal benefits?
          </p>
          <small>
            Yes. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has
            issued a circular making it effective from 1st October, 2011, which
            directs the insurance companies to allow portability from one
            insurance company to another and from one plan to another, without
            making the insured to lose the renewal credits for pre-existing
            conditions, enjoyed in the previous policy. However, this credit
            will be limited to the Sum Insured (including Bonus) under previous
            policy. For details, you may check with the insurance company.

          <p>13. What happens to the policy coverage after a claim is filed?</p>
          <small>
            After a claim is filed and settled, the policy coverage is reduced
            by the amount that has been paid out on settlement. For Example: In
            January you start a policy with a coverage of Rs 5 Lakh for the
            year. In April, you make a claim of Rs 2 lakh. The coverage
            available to you for the May to December will be the balance of Rs.3
            lakh.

            Any number of claims is allowed during the policy period unless
            there is a specific cap prescribed in any policy. However the sum
            insured is the maximum limit under the policy.

            general health check up once in a few years. Normally this is
            available once in four years.

            Family Floater is one single policy that takes care of the
            hospitalization expenses of your entire family. The policy has one
            single sum insured, which can be utilised by any/all insured persons
            in any proportion or amount subject to maximum of overall limit of

            than buying separate individual policies. Family Floater plans takes
            care of all the medical expenses during sudden illness, surgeries
            and accidents.
