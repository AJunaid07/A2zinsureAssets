            <h2>Types of Motor Insurance:</h2>
            <p>Broadly there are two types of insurances policies that offer motor insurance cover:</p>
            <div class="box">
                <small>1. Liability Only Policy (Statutory requirement)</small>
                <small>2. Package Policy (Liability Only Policy + Damage to owner's Vehicle usually called O.D
                    Cover)</small>
            </div>
            <p>Remember that if you take only a Liability Only Policy, damage to your vehicle will not be covered.
                Hence, it would be prudent to take a Package Policy which would give a wider cover, including cover for
                your vehicle.</p>
            <h2>What Motor Insurance covers:</h2>
            <p>The damages to the vehicle due to the following perils are usually covered under OD section of the Motor
                Insurance policy:</p>
            <div class="box">
                <small>1. Fire, Explosion, Self- Ignition, Lightning</small>
                <small>2. Burglary/Housebreaking / Theft</small>
                <small>3. Riot & Strike</small>
                <small>4. Earthquake</small>
                <small>5. Flood, Storm, Cyclone, Hurricane, tempest, inundation, hailstorm, frost</small>
                <small>6. Accidental external means</small>
                <small>7. Malicious Act</small>
                <small>8. Terrorism acts</small>
                <small>9. While in Transit by Rail/ Road, Inland waterways, Lift, Elevator or Air</small>
                <small>10. Land slide / Rock slide</small>
            </div>
            <h2>What Motor Insurance excludes:</h2>
            <p>The following contingencies are usually excluded under the Motor Insurance Policy:</p>
            <div class="box">
                <small>1. Not having a valid Driving License</small>
                <small>2. Under Influence of intoxicating liquor/ drugs</small>
                <small>3. Accident taking place beyond Geographical limits</small>
                <small>4. While Vehicle is used for unlawful purposes</small>
                <small>5. Electrical/Mechanical Breakdowns.</small>
            </div>
            <h2>For Own Damage:</h2>
            <p>The Sum Insured under a Motor Insurance policy reflects the value of the motor vehicle determined based
                on the concept known as Insured's Declared Value. Insured's Declared Value is the value arrived at based
                on the Manufacturer's present value and depreciation based on the Age of the Vehicle.</p>
            <h2>For Third Party:</h2>
            <p>Coverage is as per requirements of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 . Compulsory Personal accident cover for
                owner-driver is also included. Policy can also be extended to cover various other risks like Personal
                Accident to occupants of vehicle, Workmen's Compensation to Driver, etc over and above the cover
                available to him under statute</p>
            <h2>Some Question & Answer:</h2>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>1. What Motor Insurance cover should I buy? Should I buy Comprehensive Insurance or Liability only
                    Policy?</p>
                <small>Third Party Liability insurance is mandatory for all vehicles plying on public roads in India.
                    This covers Liability for injuries and damages to others that you are responsible for. In addition,
                    it is prudent to cover loss or damages to the vehicle itself by way of a Comprehensive/Package
                    policy or a Bundled Policy or a Standalone Own Damage Policy in addition to your Liability Only
                    Policy, which covers both "Liability" as well as "Own damage" to Insured vehicle. Liability Only
                    cover is also known as Act Only cover.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>2. How is the premium determined?</p>
                <small>Many factors determine the premium you will pay. For Own Damage cover different insurance
                    companies charge different premiums for similar coverage. Shop around; getting three or more
                    comparison quotes is worthwhile. Check various insurers websites; it will help you compare the
                    premiums. Do not forget to compare deductibles, coverage and IDV's as premium may be lesser of one
                    insurer but with higher deductibles, lower coverage and lower IDV, which will adversely impact you
                    in the event of claim settlement. Be prepared to give your agent information about the following
                    items that are commonly used to determine your premium: Vehicle registration details with Engine
                    no., Chasis no., Class of vehicle, cubic capacity, seating capacity, etc. (In fact, all relevant
                    details are in the RC book/card and a copy of same may be handed over), Tax paid details;
                    Certificate of fitness, Driver details age, gender, qualifications, licence validity, previous claim
                    history, if any. The Own Damage coverage is left to be rated by individual insurance companies after
                    duly filing rates with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India. The same is
                    determined on following factors amongst others -- Age of vehicle; Discounts / loadings-Appropriate
                    Bonus / loading/ discounts along with past claims experience are taken into account while
                    calculating premium, IDV (Insured Declared Value). Premium for Third Party Liability are laid down
                    by IRDAI and it is same for all insurers. In case of break in insurance, vehicle inspection would be
                    required and extra charges will have to be incurred for the same.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>3. What coverage limits meet my needs?</p>
                <small>For Own Damage, the Sum Insured for the vehicle is called ‘Insured Declared Value’ and should
                    reflect the current market value of the vehicle. For Third Party Liability cover, there is unlimited
                    coverage for death/injuries to Third Parties, however, Third party property damages are covered up
                    to a sum of Rs.750,000. Insured has option to restrict coverage for Third Party Property damage to
                    Rs.6,000 whereby there will be reduction in "Liability Only" premium.</small>

            <div class="accordion">
                <p>4. Which policy should I purchase for my new Private Car or new Two-Wheeler?</p>
                <small>You can either purchase Bundled Policy or Long-Term Liability Only Policy for term of 3 year and
                    5 year for new Private Car and new Two-Wheeler respectively. However, annual Package or annual
                    Liability only policy for new Private Car or New Two Wheeler is not available as it is not
                    permitted.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>5. When should I renew the Bundled Policy?</p>
                <small>Own-Damage (OD) cover under Bundled Policy is valid for period of one year and hence, OD section
                    should be renewed on expiry of one-year period. However, Third Party cover under the Bundled Policy
                    is valid for three years (for new Private Cars) or five years (for new Two-wheelers) and hence, it
                    should be renewed on expiry of 3 or 5 year period as the case may be.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>6. When should I approach Insurance company for renewal of my policy?</p>

                    period.</small>

                <p>7. What is Add-on Cover?</p>
                <small>Add-on cover extends the cover under the base policy on payment of additional premium. Different
                    Insurers have different Add-ons available with them. Nil Depreciation Cover, Return to Invoice
                    Cover, No Claim Bonus Protection are some of the most common Add-on covers present in the market.
                    You can visit the IRDAI website (irdai.gov.in) for detailed coverage of under these add-ons.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>8. What is "No Claim Bonus"?</p>
                <small>No Claim Bonus (NCB) is the benefit accrued to an insured for NIL claims during the previous
                    policy period. As per current norms prevalent, it ranges from 20% on the Own Damage premium (and not
                    on Liability premium) and progressively increases to a maximum of 50% based on successive claim free
                    years. If; however, a claim is lodged, the No claim Bonus is lost in the subsequent policy period.
                    NCB is given to insured and not to the insured vehicle. Hence, on transfer of the vehicle, the
                    insurance policy can be transferred to new owner but not the NCB. The new owner has to pay the
                    difference on account of NCB for the balance policy period. The original owner can, however, use the
                    NCB on a new vehicle purchased by him.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>9. Will my No Claim Bonus (NCB) get ported if I want to change my insurance company?</p>
                <small>Yes, you can avail of the NCB facility if you change the insurer on renewal. You would have to
                    produce proof of the NCB earned by way of renewal notice from the current insurer. If the same
                    cannot be produced, you may produce your original expiring policy along with a certification that no
                    claim has been lodged by yourself on the expiring policy. Hence, evidence can be in form of a
                    renewal notice or a letter confirming the NCB entitlement from the previous insurer.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion">
                <p>10. Are there discounts that will lower my premium?</p>
                <small>In addition to NCB, there could be additional discounts available under Own Damage Premium such
                    as for membership of Automobile Association of India, Vintage Cars (Pvt. Cars certified by the
                    Vintage and Classic Car Club of India); Installation of anti-theft devices approved by Automobile
