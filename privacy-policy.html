            <h2><u>Rules and Regulations for a Insurance Specified Person (ISP)</u></h2>
            <div class="section1_box">
                <p>Do(s) and Don&nbsp;t(s) of ISPs
                </p>
                <small>The Do&nbsp;s and Don&nbsp;ts of becoming AN ISP:</small>
                <small>1. An ISP can sell insurance through probable buyers. Probable buyers can be anybody. They can be
                    your friends,
                    your family, or relatives. He/she can also approach influential people like politicians, actors,
                    professors etc. He can
                    also approach his satisfied customers through whom the good word of mouth can spread.
                </small>
                <small>2. AN ISP is always expected to sell in an ethical manner. What is ethical selling? In Ethical
                    Selling the customer&nbsp;s
                    needs and requirements are given the topmost priority. All information regarding the customer should
                    be
                    kept confidential. Also, the ISP should follow a consultative way of selling rather than just
                    selling.</small>
                <small>3. AN ISP should provide the customer with After Sales Service. Since Insurance is a completely
                    service–driven
                    industry, therefore, providing After Sales Service is not a one–time activity. It is a continuous
                    process. Thus,
                    providing an after sales service is very important. It helps to maintain healthy and good
                    relationship
                    with the
                    customer and also, helps to increase business.</small>
                <small>4. AN ISP must know which products he/she is allowed to sell.</small>
                <small>5. AN ISP must acquire all the documents as per the KYC norms. After acquiring the form from the
                    customer he must
                    submit it with the insurance company.</small>
            </div>
            <h2><u>Grievance Redressal Mechanism</u></h2>
            <p>It is very important for an ISP to know the steps of grievance redressal. In case if any servicing or
                claims related issue
                arises then the policyholder can go through these following steps:</p>
            <div class="section1_box">
                <ul>
                    <li><small>Contact the call centre number of his Insurance Company. The insurance company provides a
                            unique complaint ID for the same and tries to resolve the issue</small></li>
                    <li><small>If the policyholder has not yet received the resolution or is not satisfied with the
                            response then
                            he/she can login to IGMS
                            portal (<a href="https://www.policyholder.gov.in/IGMS_Complaint_Logging.aspx">click here</a>).
                            IGMS is an integrated grievance management system. This system facilitates online
                            registration of
                            policyholder’s complaints and the ticket raised, gets registered with IRDAI. Also,
                            simultaneously it
                            gets reflected into the insurer’s account. It helps in tracking status of the complaint.
                            This is then managed
                            by the grievance redressal cell of the respective insurance company.</small></li>
                    <li><small>If this also leaves the policy holder dissatisfied, the policy holder may approach the
                            ombudsman
                            for redressal, provided the amount does not exceed 30 lakh rupees. Insurance ombudsman is a
                            non–judicial
                            authority created by Central Government.</small></li>
                    <li><small>One can even go to the consumer forum but then he should be aware of the three tier
                            judicial
                            system.
                            The first is the District Forum: Financial Jurisdiction is 20 lakhs
                            The second is the State Commission: Financial Jurisdiction is above 20 lakhs but not
                            exceeding 1CR. They
                            hear appeals against district forum
                            The third is the National Commission: Financial Jurisdiction for above 1 CR, where appeals
                            against state
                            commission is taken care of and appeal&nbsp;s against national commission lies with the
                            supreme court.</small>
                    </li>
                    <li><small>A policy holder must understand how the grievance redressal process works and as AN ISP
                            one must educate their
                            customers on the same.</small></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2><u>Anti–Money Laundering: AML and KYC Norms</u></h2>
            <h4>What is Money Laundering?</h4>
            <small>Money Laundering is the concealment of the origins of illegally obtained money, typically by means of
                transfers
                involving foreign banks or legitimate businesses. In simple words, it is the method by which “dirty
                money”
                received from criminal activities is processed through legitimate businesses and converted into “clean
                money”. Once
                cleaned, the money cannot be easily traced to the person originating the transaction or to the criminal
                origin of
                the funds</small>
            <small>
                To prevent money laundering in the insurance sector, IRDAI has setup certain guidelines via insurance
                products and
                has also asked insurance companies to report suspicious transactions.</small>
            <h4>Each insurer must establish and implement policies like:</h4>
            <div class="section1_box">
                <ul>
                    <li><small><span>Monitoring and Reporting Cash Transactions</span> Cash premium of more than Rs
                            1Lakh should never
                            be accepted. Premiums beyond Rs 1Lakh should be remitted by cheque or demand draft or credit
                            card or
                            any other banking channel. If the total premium crosses the limit of rupees 1Lakhs no
                            part–payment from
                            different modes are to be accepted. In case if the total premium exceeds Rs 50 thousand but
                            does not
                            exceed Rs. 1 lakh, cash may be collected, subject to collection and verification of PAN card
                            of proposer
                            which is mandatory.</small></li>
                    <li><small><span>Premium more than 1 Lakh</span> Be it by any mode cash, credit card, debit card,
                            etc. If the premium is
                            more than 1 lakh per annum, then proper investigation and frequent review should be
                            done.</small></li>
                    <li><small><span>Recordkeeping</span> Every insurer is required to maintain the information/ records
                            relating to
                            verification of clients for a minimum period of 5 years.</small></li>
                    <li><small><span>Customer Classification</span> Customers should be classified into high risk and
                            low risk.</small></li>
                    <li><small><span>KYC (Know your Customer)</span> In case of direct sales of life insurance products,
                            regulatory
                            guidelines mandate that insurers should conduct KYC before the sale of the policy. Linking
                            of Aadhaar
                            number to the insurance policy has also been made mandatory, this is applicable for both
                            life and general
                            insurances.
                        </small></li>
                    <li><small>To summaries, if any such suspicion arises then it should be immediately informed to the
                            compliance officer.</small></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2><u>Policyholder&nbsp;s Protection Regulations</u></h2>
            <p>IRDAI has introduced regulations to safeguard the interests of the policyholders. Let us understand some
                of these regulations:</p>
            <div class="section1_box">
                <ul>
                    <li><small>Every ISP needs to fully disclose all details about the product. Good faith needs to be
                            followed
                            and there should be transparency</small></li>
                    <li><small>As far as ISP of broker companies are concerned, comparison should be provided to the
                            prospect
                            and the most suitable policy as per the client&nbsp;s need should be recommended.</small>
                    </li>
                    <li><small>Insurers, brokers, and intermediaries should follow the code of conduct.
                        </small></li>
                    <li><small>Proposal form is compulsory in other than marine cargo.</small></li>
                    <li><small>The insurers shall ensure that a sale executed over distance marketing modes such as
                            internet,
                            SMS, telemarketing, interactive electronic medium etc. shall be undertaken by authorized and
                            qualified salespersons who are specialized in his behalf by the authorities</small></li>
                    <li><small>A policy cannot be called in question after three years of it being issued. Insurers will
                            find it
                            impossible to repudiate claims after three policy years due to the amendment.</small></li>
                    <li><small>Information about Riders: Riders are the additional benefits provided with the base
                            policy. In life
                            insurance these additional benefits are termed as “Riders” and in general insurance they are
                            referred to
                            as “Add–ons”. But in both the cases they mean the same. In case of life insurance, the
                            additional covers
                            premium, i.e., the rider’s premium should not exceed 30 percent.</small></li>
                    <li><small>Once the proposal is accepted and the premium is paid, the client can return or cancel
                            the policy
                            within the free–look period, which is applicable to only health and life insurance policies.
                            A 15 days free–
                            look is provided in cases of health and life insurance. A free–look of 30days is applicable
                            to electronic
                            policies and the ones obtained through distance mode in life insurance.
                            What is a free–look period? Free–look period is a time period in which the policyholder can
                            review the terms and
                            conditions of the policy and disagree to any of those terms or conditions. During a
                            free-look period the policyholder
                            has the right to cancel the policy. If the policyholder wishes to cancel the policy then he
                            gets the premium amount as
                            refund after deducting few expenses like the stamp duty charges, medical test expenses and
                            pro rata premium.</small></li>
