        <h2>Why Buy Life Insurance :</h2>
        <p>
          Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency linked with
          human life, like death, disability, accident, retirement etc. Human
          life is subject to risks of death and disability due to natural and
          accidental causes. When human life is lost or a person is disabled
          permanently or temporarily, there is loss of income to the household
        </p>
        <p>
          Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary sum could be determined
          based on the loss of income in future years. Hence, in life insurance,
          the Sum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid in the event of
          a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’. Life Insurance products provide a
          definite amount of money in case the life insured dies during the term
          of the policy or becomes disabled on account of an accident.
        </p>

        <h2>Why you should buy Life Insurance :</h2>
        <p>All of us face the following risks:</p>

        <div class="box">
          <small>1. Dying too soon</small>
          <small>2. Living too long</small>
        </div>

        <h2>Life Insurance is needed :</h2>

        <div class="box">
          <small>
            1. To ensure that your immediate family has some financial support
            in the event of your demise

          Primarily, anyone who has a family to support and is an income earner
          needs Life Insurance. In view of the economic value of their

          Even children can be considered for life insurance in view of their
          future income potential being at risk.
        </p>

        <h2>How much Life Insurance is needed :</h2>
        <p>

            requirements and expectations</small
          >

          <small>
            2. Seek and receive advice and options patiently Be open-minded but
            cautious about the advice and information you gather Ask lots of
            questions about the policy options to see what fits your needs Find
            out policy details like: Whether it is a Single Premium or Regular
            Premium policy Which is the best premium payment frequency that
            suits you eg: Annual, quarterly etc. Whether there is an ECS
            (Electronic Clearing Service) payment option to make your premium
            payment safe and easy.
          </small>

          <small>
            3. Fill the proposal form very carefully and personally Fill it
            completely and truthfully, Remember you are responsible for its
            contents Make sure that the information you give cannot be disputed
            during a claim Ensure you fill Nomination details If the form is in
            one language and you are answering the questions in a different
            language Ensure the questions are explained correctly to you and
            That you have understood them completely Remember you have to give a
            declaration to this effect in the proposal form.
          </small>
          <small>
            4. Keep a copy of the completed proposal form you sign and any
            declarations and terms agreed upon mutually for your records.
          </small>

          <small>
            5. If you are buying Unit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs) ask
            specific questions about:
          </small>

          <ul>
            <li>Various charges</li>

          <small>2. Do not let anyone else fill it up</small>
          <small
            >3. Do not conceal or misstate any facts as this could lead to
            disputes at the time of a claim</small
          >

          <p>1. What should I look for before I decide to buy a policy?</p>
          <small>
            You must check and see whether or not there is availability of
            guarantee of return, what the lock in period is, details of premium
            to be paid, what would be implications of premium default, what the

          <small>
            The disclosures made in a proposal are the basis for underwriting a
            policy and therefore any wrong statements or disclosures can lead to
            denial of a claim.

            insurance?

          <small>
            In case of certain proposals, depending upon the age of entry, age
            at maturity, sum assured, family history and personal history,
            special medical reports may be necessary for consideration of a
            risk. E.g. if the proposer is overweight, special reports like
            Electro Cardiogram, Glucose Tolerance test etc could be required,
            while for underweight proposers, X-ray of the chest and lungs with
            reports could be required.

            4. What is meant by Paid-up Value in Conventional Life Insurance
            Policy?
          </p>
          <small>
            After premiums are paid for a certain defined period or beyond and
            if subsequent premiums are not paid, the sum assured is reduced to a
            proportionate sum, which bears the same ratio to the full sum
            assured as the number of premiums actually paid bears to the total
            number originally stipulated in the policy. For example, if sum
            assured is 1 lakh and the total number of premiums is payable is 20
            (20 years policy, mode of premium is assumed yearly) and default
            occurs after 10 yearly premiums are paid, the policy acquires the
            paid up value of 50,000/-. Paid up Value = No. of Premiums Paid /
            No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X 100000 = 50000/-. This means
            that the policy is effective as before except that from the date the
            11th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- instead of
            original 1,00,000/-. To this sum assured the bonus already vested
            (accrued) before the policy lapsed, is also added. Example if the
            bonus accrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total paid up
            value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.

          <small>
            Surrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this paid up value.
            Surrender value is calculated as per the surrender value factor,
            which depends on the premiums paid and elapsed duration.

          <small>
            Usually the Insurance Company will send intimation attaching the
            discharge voucher to the policy holder at least 2 to 3 months in
            advance of the date of maturity of the policy intimating the claim
            amount payable. The policy bond and the discharge voucher duly
            signed and witnessed are to be returned to the insurance company
            immediately so that the insurance company will be able to make
            payment. If the policy is assigned in favour of any other person the
            claim amount will be paid only to the assignee who will give the
            discharge.

            The basic documents that are generally required are death
            certificate, claim form and policy bond, Other documents such as
            medical attendant's certificate, hospital certificate, employer's
            certificate, police inquest report, post mortem report etc could be

          <p>6. What are the Charges, fees and deductions in a ULIP ?</p>
          <small>
            ULIPs offered by different insurers have varying charge structures.
            Broadly, the different types of fees and charges are given below.
            However it may be noted that insurers have the right to revise fees
            and charges over a period of time. Premium Allocation Charge This is
            a percentage of the premium appropriated towards charges before
            allocating the units under the policy. This charge normally includes
            initial and renewal expenses apart from commission expenses.
            Mortality Charges These are charges to provide for the cost of
            insurance coverage under the plan. Mortality charges depend on
            number of factors such as age, amount of coverage, state of health
            etc. Fund Management Fees These are fees levied for management of
            the fund(s) and are deducted before arriving at the Net Asset Value
            (NAV) . Policy/ Administration Charges These are the fees for
            administration of the plan and levied by cancellation of units. This
            could be flat throughout the policy term or vary at a predetermined
            rate. Surrender Charges A surrender charge may be deducted for
            premature partial or full encashment of units wherever applicable,
            as mentioned in the policy conditions. Fund Switching Charge
            Generally a limited number of fund switches may be allowed each year
            without charge, with subsequent switches, subject to a charge.
            Service Tax Deductions Before allotment of the units the applicable
            service tax is deducted from the risk portion of the premium.
            Investors may note, that the portion of the premium after deducting
            for all charges and premium for risk cover is utilized for
            purchasing units.

          <p>8. How much of the premium is used to purchase units?</p>
          <small>
            The full amount of premium paid is not allocated to purchase units.
            Insurers allot units on the portion of the premium remaining after
            providing for various charges, fees and deductions. However the
            quantum of premium used to purchase units varies from product to
            product. The total monetary value of the units allocated is
            invariably less than the amount of premium paid because the charges
            are first deducted from the premium collected and the remaining
            amount is used for allocating units.
